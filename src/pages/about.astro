		So it turns out that the fungi shown in the picture is not actually a mycorrhizal fungi. It is <i>Meripilus sumstinei</i>
, aka the Black Staining Polypore. No matter -- what a beaut, eh?

		My name is Justin Pewitt Moore. I live in Stanford, CA and am originally from Franklin, TN. I'm fascinated by:
		<ul>
		<ol> math and have been since 1993. </ol>
		<ol> computers and have been since 1998. </ol>
		<ol> ultimate frisbee and have been since 2004. </ol>
		<ol> space and have been since 2006. </ol>
		<ol> bitcoin and have been since 2012. </ol>
		<ol> fungi and have been since 2017. </ol>

		MycoJMO is a new project where I bring my talents to you and your organization to collaboratively discover what is needed. Maybe you already know -- so I'll build (or untangle, or document/understand) that. Maybe we'll discover it together. Myco relates to fungi. I would have liked to bring mycorrhizae into the name, but I was informed that's too complicated!

		As I understand it, no plant can get much taller than ~1ft without the aid of fungi:  two kingdoms working together. Mycorrhizal fungi represent this connecting point between the kingdoms:  plants and fungi. The fungi mine the soil for additional resources and to make the roots collect water more efficiently. In return, the plants provide the fungi with sugars that it cannot otherwise create. A beautiful symbiotic relationship that I hope to model.

		Your tree. Your roots. My spores, metaphorically of course. Let's collaborate! Please reach out if you're intrigued.
